# Oscillating-Platform
 Created an oscillating platform for the player to interact with.

Created a third-person platformer starter scene from this module's Unity asset package. Built a rotator component within the scene by implementing C# scripting and vector mathematics to the rotator component. Also built an oscillating platform by implementing C# scripting and vector mathematics into it.

The character/player is able to successfully navigate across the oscillating platform and over the pit while moving along the platform using Fixed Update and being able to pick the collectibles around the environment.
