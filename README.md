# Oscillating-Platform
 Creating an oscillating platform for the player to interact with.

Created a third-person platformer starter scene from this module's Unity asset package. Built a rotator component within the scene by implementing C# scripting and vector mathematics to the rotator component. Also built an oscialltign platform by implementing C# scripting and vector mathematics to it. 

The character/player is able to successfully navigtate across the osciallting platform and over the pit while moving along the platform using Fixed Update and being able to pick the collectables around the environment.
